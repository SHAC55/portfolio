        Hi, I’m a full-stack web developer with hands-on experience building
        real-world applications using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I’ve
        worked on several projects throughout my journey, each focused on
        solving real problems with clean, responsive, and user-friendly
        interfaces. In addition to web development, I’m actively learning Data
        Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java to sharpen my problem-solving
        skills, and exploring DevOps to gain a deeper understanding of
        deployment pipelines, CI/CD, and scalable infrastructure. I'm passionate
        about continuous learning, writing efficient code, and turning ideas
        into impactful digital solutions.
